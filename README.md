Example R Shiny application which combines the extension input components provided in shinyExt with DataTables (http://www.datatables.net/) and Select2 (http://ivaynberg.github.com/select2/). In addition, I added ability to export data from DataTables using the TableTools extra (http://www.datatables.net/extras/tabletools/). Also made some minor changes to the shinyExt package to provide common date-range options and ability to define a default value
